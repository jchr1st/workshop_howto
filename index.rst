Nutanix Workshops HOWTO
-----------------------

The purpose of this living document is to provide a complete reference for how to properly run a Nutanix Workshop or Bootcamp using RX, the Hosted POC environment, and the Nutanix Hands on Workshops platform.

Workshop V. Bootcamp
++++++++++++++++++++

**What's the difference?!**

Generally, we use **Workshops** to refer to internal or partner facing hands on lab content. **Bootcamps** are customer facing, funded marketing events that can be used for lead generation and accelerating deals.

Planning a Bootcamp
...................

Work with your local Field Marketing Manager (FMM) to make a Bootcamp event landing and registration page. FMMs also help with identifying event locations, giveaway swag, and pipeline tracking.

- Work with your stakeholders (Acctount Manager/Channel Partner/Prospect/Customer) to plan the Bootcamp date and agenda.
- The account team(s) should drive attendees to register.
- Supporting materials are on GDrive in the `Technology Bootcamp <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_IfSpggJeFVfjdrVUxkZ25tQVRINHFVMkl4TFpWMG1GUUNhOVhaWnJOZ1gtSkJfa2QzSGc>`_ folder.
- FMMs have access to an additional pool of Marketing clusters outside of the normal HPOC.
- If Marketing clusters are not available, make a HPOC reservation(s) on https://rx.corp.nutanix.com/.

Day of the Bootcamp
...................

- Arrive early, survey the site, and touch base with the onsite facilities contact.
- Send link to the Bootcamp, and any updates, to the e-mail attendee list.
- Have them register for the *nutanix.handsonworkshops.com* site if this is their first time attending a Bootcamp or Workshop.
- If they have attended a Bootcamp or Workshop before, simply have them login with the user/password they used prior.
- Project WiFi and Agenda info
