FMM Planning Tips
+++++++++++++++++

- Plan 1-2 months ahead – Reviewing the data of MKT block reservations, we typically see a lot of availability 30-45 days out. Where possible, planning bootcamps 45+ days in advance will help ensure the availability of cluster resources.

- Aim for 12-15 attendees per bootcamp - We recommend keeping these to 12-15 attendees so that the SE can maintain a personalized discussion with attendees.
    - For a larger audience, scale the # of SEs that are helping based on the anticipated size of the audience. Recommendation is for 1 additional SE for every 5-10 attendees.

- Prioritize Bootcamps based on value - To-date, it’s been primarily first come/first serve for who books clusters. We ask that you be extra mindful when reserving clusters due to limited cluster availability. Only reserve a cluster for bootcamps that have a qualified audience (i.e. larger audience, closer to a purchase decision, stronger prospects) and de-prioritize those that have an audience of fewer, weaker, and more distant purchasers.
    - For deprioritized audiences, leverage Nutanix Test Drive where possible
      - Private cloud - AOS & AHV
      - Hybrid Cloud -  Clusters
      - Simplify Data Management - Files, Objects, Block
      - Secure Your Applications - Flow
      - AI Ops and Automateion - Prism Pro & Calm
      - Elimiate Backup Silos -  
      - Simplify Database Operations - Era  
    
    - Test Drive conveys quite a few benefits:
      - Fewer limits in terms of resourcing since we’re leveraging the Public Cloud (although not infinite)
      - Less time investment required by prospects and customers, as the Test Drive labs are designed to be completed in less than 20 minutes
      - Qualified leads – Test Drive captures key data and statistics and coordinates among Marketo, SFDC, and Adobe Analytics to identify who took which labs, for how long, and if they are an existing customer or new prospect.

- Reserve the cluster for 48 hours - You will need to reserve a cluster for 48 hours (for the day before and day of the event) so that the SE can foundation and provide logins to end users the day before the event.
    - If DR capabilities are required, consider using the PHX-SingleNode Pool in RX to demonstrate Protection Domains. The PHX-SingleNode pool is available to all SEs

- Keep Cluster Reservation open to 9pm or few hours past bootcamp hours for attendees to work on labs offline

- Leverage Sales HPOC blocks if MKTG clusters are unavailable – SEs will have access to HPOC blocks other than what FMMs can see.

- Secure at least two SEs for your event - You will need to have at least one SE (or more depending on audience) on the zoom to help answer chat questions and to support the SE coordinating the bootcamp.

- Plan giveaways and/or raffles during the event - Plan giveaways and/or raffles during the event to keep the audience engaged and encourage participation.
    - Reward the first person to complete a lab, first person to answer a question in chat, Randomly raffle-off items, etc.
    - Giveaway bootcamp backpacks (funded by corporate in the internal store)
    - Fund additional raffles for e-gift cards like Uber Eats, Doordash, Starbucks
- Build an event landing page - Landing page copy and email copy for a virtual bootcamp is available in the NRS under “Virtual Technology Field Bootcamp Template”.
    - Make sure to include all relevant time zones in your landing pages and reminder emails if the bootcamp is shared with different time zones (I.e. Mid-atlantic covers both CST and EST)
    - Shift scheduled In-person bootcamps to Virtual ones - Change landing page copy and email copy in the event tool so reflect the changes. In the email copy make sure you have a Zoom link in there so they can join during the Bootcamp.
