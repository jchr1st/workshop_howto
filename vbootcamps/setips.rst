SE Planning Tips
+++++++++++++++++

Plan 1-2 months ahead – Build out a virtual bootcamp calendar with your Field Marketing Manager.

    - Work with your FMM to publish and spread the event schedule to all prospects, customers and partners

Ensure that you have the cluster at least 24 hours prior to the bootcamp event - Your Field Marketing Manager will reserve a Marketing cluster if available.

Prep before - Familiarize yourself with Zoom, whiteboarding tools, and dry run with the group of SEs before the event.

    - You do not need a special Zoom license. If you do not have a Zoom, ask X-bot in slack
    - All supporting SEs should go through the bootcamp’s labs before the event so they know which labs are completed during the event
    - Day before, walk through the online guide to ensure everything is working properly

Send personalized emails to attendees - The day before the event send out personalized emails to every attendee with their login information.
