Presentation Tips
+++++++++++++++++

Walk through a presentation deck
Leverage a Whiteboard (physical or virtual) - If you have a whiteboard at home, consider setting up your camera and using it for diagramming and illustrations. Alternatively, for virtual options:

    - Zoom - Share > Whiteboard
    - Powerpoint - In presenter mode, in the presentation, mouse-over the bottom left corner for annotation options
    - Use a whiteboarding tool:

        - iPad with Pencil
        - MS Surface with Surface Pen
        - SEs can order a Wacom Tablet from Best Buy  – this should be ordered a week or two before the event and can be used for the whiteboarding during the bootcamp:

            - https://www.bestbuy.com/site/wacom-intuos-wireless-graphic-tablet-small-with-3-bonus-software-included-black/6196634.p?skuId=6196634 – a small learning curve on using it

Go through the bootcamp’s exercises step by step on each exercise so users can see what you are doing and they follow with you.
To keep the audience engaged ask questions. Offer assistance to anyone needing help with any step as you go through the bootcamp’s exercises.

    - Applications to consider using during the bootcamp (optional and use if it works for you):

        - Krisp noise cancellation - https://krisp.ai/
        - Sketch app - https://www.doodly.com/
