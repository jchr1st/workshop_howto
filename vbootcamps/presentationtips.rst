Presentation Tips
+++++++++++++++++

- **Walk through a presentation deck**
- **Leverage a Whiteboard (physical or virtual)** - If you have a whiteboard at home, consider setting up your camera and using it for diagramming and illustrations. Alternatively, for virtual options:
    - Zoom - Share > Whiteboard
    - Powerpoint - In presenter mode, in the presentation, mouse-over the bottom left corner for annotation options
    - Use a whiteboarding tool:
        - iPad with Pencil
        - MS Surface with Surface Pen
        - SEs can order a Wacom Tablet from Best Buy  – this should be ordered a week or two before the event and can be used for the whiteboarding during the bootcamp:
            - https://www.bestbuy.com/site/wacom-intuos-wireless-graphic-tablet-small-with-3-bonus-software-included-black/6196634.p?skuId=6196634 – a small learning curve on using it
- **Go through the bootcamp’s exercises** - Start the bootcamp and go through step by step on each exercise so users can see what you are doing and they follow with you.
- **Ask the audience questions and/or ask if anyone needs help** - Make sure to ask questions to keep the audience engaged. Ask if anyone needs help with any step as you go through the bootcamp’s exercises.
- **Consider downloading additional tools** - Applications to consider using during the bootcamp (optional and use if it works for you)
