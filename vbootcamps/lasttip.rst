One Last Tip
++++++++++++

If this is the first time you are running your chosen boot, always book some time to familiarize yourself with everything your customer is going to be asked to do.  That way you will be prepared to answer thier question or help relove issues if they get stuck.  Adequate preperation will amplify their confidence in Nutanix.

If you haven't delivered the chosen bootcamp for a while, we strongly suggest taking the time to refamiliarize with the Bootcamp & associated guide.
