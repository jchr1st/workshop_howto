One Last Tip
++++++++++++

If this is the first time you are running your chosen boot, always book some time to familiarize yourself with everything your customer is going to be asked to do.  That way you will be prepared to answer their question or help resolve issues if they get stuck.  Adequate preparation will amplify their confidence in Nutanix.

If you haven't delivered the chosen Bootcamp for a while, we strongly suggest taking the time to re-familiarize with the Bootcamp & associated guide.
