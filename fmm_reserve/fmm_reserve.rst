Reserving A Marketing Cluster
-----------------------------

Generally, you will want to reserve the cluster at least 45 days before your desired event date to ensure Marketing cluster availability. We recommend planning ahead by working with your SE to plan and build out a schedule for the entire quarter.

#. Click **Confirm** to complete the reservation.

Once the cluster is reserved, SE and FMM will receive a confirmation email, if the FMM shared the reservation. That email contains important reservation and access details for the cluster.

The SE leading the boot camp is responsible for verifying that the foundation succeeded and the cluster is ready for the event. This should be done the **DAY BEFORE** the event so that should there be any complications there is time for the Outcome Engineering (OE) or Technical Marketing Engeering (TME) teams to resolve.


What If No Marketing Clusters Are Available?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Check with the SE as they have access to additional clusters.

.. note::

    PHX-SNC (Phoenix Single Node Cluster Pool) is often very open and we’ve recently rolled out the option for SEs to stage some Bootcamps using Single Node Clusters in the staging scripts. Currently there are ~75 single node clusters available in the pool and these are often more available than four node clusters.
    **These will not work for all Bootcamps. Consult with the SE first**

Alternatively, try emailing hostedpoc@nutanix.com to see if they have any clusters set aside that are available for your event date.
